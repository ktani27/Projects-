# Franck Tani Data Analyst Portfolio 
## About 
Hi I 'm Franck. I have a background in business admnistration, but I switched to Information technology after falling in love with the power of analytics during my time as an real estate admnistrative assistant. I was one of the most computer-saavy team member so the CIO relied on me with many tasks. This is when I discovered the world of databases and the power SQL. 

Since then, I decided to immerse myself into tech and to become a data analyst. I got one step closer to my goal by  obtaining a master's degree in Management Information Systems with a concentration in project management. 
Now, I have a created this repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data analytics/Data engineering related topics. 



## Python Projects 
### Building a Retail Data Pipeline 
**Goal**: Creating a data pipeline for the analysis of Walmart's supply and demand around the holidays , along with conducting a preliminary analysis of the data.

**Description**: The project focused on building a data pipeline using custom functions to extract, transform, aggregates, and loads e-commerce data. I used the data from the [grocery_sales](https://github.com/ktani27/Projects-/blob/main/assets/Grocery_sales.png) table in PostgreSQL and from the [extra_data]() parquet file.   

**Code**: [Building a retail data pipeline](https://github.com/ktani27/Projects-/blob/main/assets/Building%20a%20Retail%20Data%20Pipeline.py) 

**Skills**: Data cleaning, data analysis, data engineering 

**Technology**: Python, SQL   
### Cleaning Bank Marketing Campaign Data 
**Goal**: Cleaning a bank marketing dataset 

**Description**: During this project, I used many data cleaning techniques to ready the dataset for processing among which:
- Data types conversion
- Missing value replacement 
- Dataset split into two subsets.

[You can find a data description in the picture below](https://github.com/ktani27/Projects-/blob/main/assets/Analyzing%20Students%20Mental%20Health%20Data%20Description%20.png)  

**Code**: [Analyzing Students Mental Health](https://github.com/ktani27/Projects-/blob/main/assets/Analyzing%20Students'%20Mental%20Health.sql)

The query returns the count of internationals for a given length of stay, and their average score on depression, social connectedness, and accumulative stress. 
[Here is the query's result](https://github.com/ktani27/Projects-/blob/main/assets/Analzyng%20Students%20Mental%20Health%20Query%20results.png)
