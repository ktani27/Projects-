# Franck Tani - Data Analyst Portfolio 
## About 
Hi I 'm Franck. I have a background in Business Admnistration, but I switched to Information technology after falling in love with the power of analytics during my time as an real estate admnistrative assistant. This is when I was introduced to the world of databases and the power SQL. 

Since then, I decided to immerse myself into tech and to become a data analyst. I got one step closer to my goal by  obtaining a master's degree in Management Information Systems with a concentration in project management. 

Now, I have a created this repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data analytics/Data engineering related topics. 



## Python Projects 
### Building a Retail Data Pipeline 
**Goal**: Creating a data pipeline for the analysis of Walmart's supply and demand around the holidays.

**Description**: The project focused on building a data pipeline using custom functions to extract, transform, aggregates, and loads e-commerce data. I used the data from the [grocery_sales](https://github.com/ktani27/Projects-/blob/main/assets/Grocery_sales.png) table in PostgreSQL and from the [extra_data](https://github.com/ktani27/Projects-/blob/main/assets/Walmart%20sales%20Extra%20data%20Parquet%20files%20.png) parquet file.   

**Code**: [Building a retail data pipeline](https://github.com/ktani27/Projects-/blob/main/assets/Building%20a%20Retail%20Data%20Pipeline.py) 

**Skills**: Data cleaning, data analysis, data engineering 

**Technology**: Python, SQL   
### Cleaning Bank Marketing Campaign Data 
**Goal**: Cleaning a bank marketing dataset 

**Description**: During this project, I used many data cleaning techniques to perform operations on the [bank marketing dataset](https://github.com/ktani27/Projects-/blob/main/assets/bank_marketing.csv) for processing among which:
- Data types conversion
- Missing values replacement 
- Split of the dataset into three subsets:
  - [client](https://github.com/ktani27/Projects-/blob/main/assets/Cleaning%20bank%20data%20client%20table%20.png)
  - [campaign](https://github.com/ktani27/Projects-/blob/main/assets/Cleaning%20bank%20data%20campaign%20table%20.png)
  - [economics](https://github.com/ktani27/Projects-/blob/main/assets/Cleaning%20bank%20data%20economics%20.png)

**Code**: [Cleaning Bank Marketing Data](https://github.com/ktani27/Projects-/blob/main/assets/Cleaning%20Bank%20Marketing%20Data.py) 

**Skills**: Data cleaning 

**Technology**: Python 
## SQL Projects 
### Analyzing Industry Carbon Emissions 
Description: The [product_emissions table](https://github.com/ktani27/Projects-/blob/main/assets/Product%20Emissions%20.png) contains product carbon footprints (PCFs) for various companies. The records include the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to given product measured in CO2. 

**Code**: [Analyzing Industry Carbon Emissions](https://github.com/ktani27/Projects-/blob/main/assets/Analyzing%20Industry%20Carbon%20Emissions.ipynb) 

**Analysis**: Based on the [query's result](https://github.com/ktani27/Projects-/blob/main/assets/Analyzing%20the%20Carbon%20Industry%20Query%20.png), the worst offenders, as far as global emissions, are:

-The materials industry with a product carbon footprint of 107129
- In second position, we have the capital goods industry with a PCF of 94942.7, which is three times more than the next industry on the list (Technology Hardware & Equipment). 


**Skills**: Data Manipulation 

**Technology**: SQL
### Analyzing Students' Mental Health 
**Goal**: The project consists in finding out if international have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population. 

**Description**: 
[You can find a data description in the picture below](https://github.com/ktani27/Projects-/blob/main/assets/Analyzing%20Students%20Mental%20Health%20Data%20Description%20.png)  

**Code**: [Analyzing Students Mental Health](https://github.com/ktani27/Projects-/blob/main/assets/Analyzing%20Students'%20Mental%20Health.sql)

The query returns the count of internationals for a given length of stay, and their average score on depression, social connectedness, and accumulative stress. 
[Here is the query's result](https://github.com/ktani27/Projects-/blob/main/assets/Analzyng%20Students%20Mental%20Health%20Query%20results.png) 

**Skills**: Data Manipulation, Data analysis  

**Technology**: SQL
